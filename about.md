I grew up in Santa Clarita, California with my lovely parents and older brother. I came to Cal Poly as a Biochemistry major in the Fall of 2020 with eager eyes. The past two years, I have enjoyed learning chemistry in this beautiful place, going on hikes, exploring the beach, and finding new restaruants. In my free time, I enjoy going for runs and baking!
