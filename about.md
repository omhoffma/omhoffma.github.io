I grew up in Santa Clarita, California with my parents, older brother, and Scottish Terrier Fergus. I came to Cal Poly as a Biochemistry major in the Fall of 2020 with eager eyes. The past two years, I have enjoyed learning chemistry in this beautiful place, going on hikes, exploring the beach, and finding new restaruants. In my free time, I enjoy going for runs and baking!

One of my lifelong goals is to always help people, which has influenced my career goals. Right now, I am very interested in Pharmacy. I love learning about the synthesis of different drugs and how they affect the body.
