**Palandoken Research Group**

_January 2022-Present_

In January, I was asked to join Dr. Palandoken's research group focusing on oxime ether synthesis in organic chemistry. Since then, I have worked alongside a professor and fellow peers facilitating organic chemistry reactions. I have independently set up and carried out reactions and run analyses studying the alkoxyamine functional group in new materials as ligating sites for carbonyl substrates.  The alkoxyamines are also tested as polymers for controlled release of carbonyl compounds.


**My Research Interests**
I really enjoy organic chemistry synthesis, as I find the process itself to be a sort of puzzle. I have not yet taken Biochemistry or Physical chemistry, so I am hoping that both of those classes spark interest as well.
